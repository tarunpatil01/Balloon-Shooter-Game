This is a repository for my First-Year project—a Balloon Shooter game created using Pygame.

ℹ️Features:


1.Increasing Difficulty: As you pop balloons, the speed of their movement increases, making the game progressively harder.


2.Attractive User Interface (UI): The game features a visually appealing UI with vibrant colors, smooth animations, and easy-to-navigate menus, enhancing the overall gaming experience.


3.Pause and Restart: The game includes pause and restart functionality, allowing players to take a break or start over at any time.

📝How to Play:
If you'd like to play the game on your PC, follow these steps:

->Download the project files individually or as a complete ZIP file.
Extract the files into a folder on your PC.
Run the BalloonShooter.exe file.
Enjoy the game!
