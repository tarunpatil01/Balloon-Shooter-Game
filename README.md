This is a Repo of my FY year project in which I had made a Balloon shooter game using Pygame.

Want to play(run) it in your PC:
You can use this project and all files by downloading it individually or complete ZIP file 
ann then paste it in a folder and run the BalloonShooter.py file or BalloonShooter.exe
and Enkoy playing.

Remember to open folder in VS code first
